#### 1.1 Sale and Issuance of Series Seed Preferred Stock.

1.1.1 The Company will adopt and file the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, in substantially the form of Exhibit C attached to this Agreement (as the same may be amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time) (the "Restated Certificate") with the Secretary of State of the State of Incorporation on or before the Initial Closing.

1.1.2 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each investor listed as a purchaser on Schedule 1 (each, a "Purchaser") will purchase at the applicable Closing and the Company agrees to sell and issue to such Purchaser at such Closing that number of shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock of the Company ("Series Seed Preferred Stock") set forth opposite such Purchaser's name on Schedule 1, at a purchase price per share equal to the Purchase Price.

#### 1.2 Closing; Delivery.

1.2.1 The initial purchase and sale of the shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock hereunder will take place remotely via the exchange of documents and signatures on the Agreement Date or any subsequent date on which one or more Purchasers execute counterpart signature pages to this Agreement and deliver the aggregate Purchase Price to the Company (such date, the "Initial Closing").

1.2.2 At any time and from time to time during the 90-day period immediately following the Initial Closing (the "Additional Closing Period"), the Company may, at one or more additional closings (each an "Additional Closing" and together with the Initial Closing, each, a "Closing"), offer and sell to investors acceptable to Refactor Capital, L.P. (the "New Purchasers"), at a per share purchase price equal to the Purchase Price, up to that number of shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock that is equal to the quotient of (x) Total Series Seed Investment Amount divided by (y) the Purchase Price, rounded up to the next whole share (the "Total Shares Authorized for Sale") less the number of shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock actually issued and sold by the Company at the Initial Closing and any prior Additional Closings.  New Purchasers may include Persons who are already Purchasers under this Agreement.  Each of the New Purchasers purchasing shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock at an Additional Closing will execute counterpart signature pages to this Agreement and each New Purchaser will, upon delivery by such New Purchaser and acceptance by the Company of such New Purchaser's signature page and delivery of the aggregate Purchase Price by such New Purchaser to the Company, become a party to, and bound by, this Agreement to the same extent as if such New Purchaser had been a Purchaser at the Initial Closing. Each New Purchaser will be deemed to be a Purchaser for all purposes under this Agreement as of the date of the applicable Additional Closing.

1.2.3 Promptly following each Closing, if required by the Company's governing documents, the Company will deliver to each Purchaser participating in that Closing a certificate representing the shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock being purchased by that Purchaser at that Closing against payment of the aggregate Purchase Price therefor by check payable to the Company, by wire transfer to a bank account designated by the Company, by cancellation or conversion of indebtedness or other convertible securities of the Company issued primarily for capital raising purposes (e.g., simple agreement for future equity) to such Purchaser or by any combination of such methods.

Each Major Purchaser has the right of first refusal to purchase the Major Purchaser's Pro Rata Share of any New Securities (each as defined below) that the Company may from time to time issue after the Agreement Date; provided, however, the Major Purchaser will have no right to purchase any such New Securities if the Major Purchaser cannot demonstrate to the Company's reasonable satisfaction that such Major Purchaser is at the time of the proposed issuance of such New Securities an "accredited investor" as such term is defined in Regulation D of the Securities Act.  A Major Purchaser's "Pro Rata Share" for means the ratio of (a) the number of shares of Common Stock issued or issuable upon conversion of the shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock owned by such Major Purchaser, to (b) the Fully Diluted Share Number. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Fully-Diluted Share Number" shall mean that number of shares of the Company's capital stock equal to the sum of (i) all shares of the Company's capital stock, (on an as-converted basis) issued and outstanding, assuming exercise or converstion of all options, warrants, and other convertible securities and (ii) all shares of the Company's capital stock reserved and available for future grant under any equity incentive or similar plan.

#### 5.2 New Securities.  

"New Securities" means any Common Stock or Preferred Stock, whether now authorized or not, and rights, options or warrants to purchase Common Stock or Preferred Stock, and securities of any type whatsoever that are, or may become, convertible or exchangeable into Common Stock or Preferred Stock; provided, however, that "New Securities" does not include: (a) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable upon conversion of any outstanding shares of Preferred Stock; (b) shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock issuable upon exercise of any options, warrants, or rights to purchase any securities of the Company outstanding as of the Agreement Date and any securities issuable upon the conversion thereof; (c) shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock issued in connection with any stock split, stock dividend or recapitalization; (d) shares of Common Stock (or options, warrants or rights therefor) granted or issued after the Agreement Date to employees, officers, directors, contractors, consultants or advisers to, the Company or any subsidiary of the Company pursuant to incentive agreements, stock purchase or stock option plans, stock bonuses or awards, warrants, contracts or other arrangements that are approved by the Board; (e) shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock issued pursuant to this Agreement; (f) any other shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock (and/or options or warrants therefor) issued or issuable primarily for other than equity financing purposes and approved by the Board; and (g) shares of Common Stock issued or issuable by the Company to the public pursuant to a registration statement filed under the Securities Act.

#### 5.3 Procedures.  

If the Company proposes to undertake an issuance of New Securities, it will give notice to each Major Purchaser of its intention to issue New Securities (the "Notice"), describing the type of New Securities and the price and the general terms upon which the Company proposes to issue the New Securities.  Each Major Purchaser will have 10 days from the date of the Notice, to agree in writing to purchase such Major Purchaser's Pro Rata Share of such New Securities for the price and upon the general terms specified in the Notice by giving written notice to the Company and stating therein the quantity of New Securities to be purchased (not to exceed such Major Purchaser's Pro Rata Share).

#### 5.4 Failure to Exercise.  

If the Major Purchasers fail to exercise in full the right of first refusal within the 10-day period, then the Company will have one hundred twenty (120) days thereafter to sell the New Securities with respect to which the Major Purchasers' rights of first refusal hereunder were not exercised, at a price and upon general terms not materially more favorable to the purchasers thereof than specified in the Company's Notice to the Major Purchasers.  If the Company has not issued and sold the New Securities within the 120-day period, then the Company will not thereafter issue or sell any New Securities without again first offering those New Securities to the Major Purchasers pursuant to this Section 5.
